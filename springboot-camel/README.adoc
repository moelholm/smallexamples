# Spring Boot :: Apache Camel

This example shows a very simple application mixing Spring Boot with Apache Camel.

## Worth noticing
Take a look at `build.gradle`: The example pulls in Apache Camels Spring Boot starter module. With that
we get a lot of functionality out of the box. For example the `CamelContext`...

There is a single (direct) route and a corresponding integration test.

The route reads an external property and uses Apache Camel's simple expression language to enrich
the incoming `Exchange` body. The result is placed in the IN `Message` body.

The integration test shows that we can inject a `ProducerTemplate` and use it to invoke the route.
